## [Scalable CSS](http://mrmrs.cc/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/)

I really enjoy using tachyons - a functional css library built by the author [Adam Morse](https://twitter.com/mrmrs_) and this article is a great insight into the problems of writing css at scale and the arguments for a different method.

One of my favourite quotes

> When I read about or listen to ideas on how to scale an appâ€™s css - most of the talk is about how to write css. The real way to scale css, is to stop writing css.
